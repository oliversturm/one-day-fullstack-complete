## The Plan

- Create an application system with lots of modern architectural components

  - CQRS/Event Sourcing backend
  - React frontend
  - Cool bidirectional communications

- To fully understand the wheel, it may be necessary to reinvent it

---

## CQRS / Event Sourcing

- CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  - Separate execution paths and data models for commands and queries
- Event Sourcing: Derive all application system state from a central log of events
